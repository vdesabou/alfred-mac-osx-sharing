alfred-mac-osx-sharing
==========================

Use built-in sharing introduced in Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion directly from Alfred!

## Description

This workflow is using the amazing command line [*terminal-share*](https://github.com/mattt/terminal-share)
 
You can call directly *share* command (or use a hotkey) if you just want to share a message.
If you want to share a file (image, video or any other kind), you can select it using a File Action, or set a hotkey.
 
It currently supports all services except sinaweibo,youku and tudou (I can add them in a future release).
 
Based on the type of the selected file, services proposed will change.
 
Here are some examples:
